# SPU-Food-Analysis
An interactive dashboard for examining student responses, justifying the rationale for setting up a food bank within the school.

* Springforth University (SpU) is in the process of establishing an on-campus foodbank in partnership with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
* However, SpU must substantiate the reasons for UNESCO sponsorship with empirical evidence. 
* To achieve this, the university conducted a survey among its students to assess the impact of food insecurity on academic performance. 
* This project aims to assist the university in making a well-informed decision regarding the necessity of creating a UNESCO-sponsored foodbank.
