# SPU-Food-Analysis
An interactive dashboard for examining student responses, justifying the rationale for setting up a food bank within the school

Springforth University (SpU) is in the process of establishing an on-campus foodbank in partnership with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
However, SpU must substantiate the reasons for UNESCO sponsorship with empirical evidence. 
To achieve this, the university conducted a survey among its students to assess the impact of food insecurity on academic performance. 
This project aims to assist the university in making a well-informed decision regarding the necessity of creating a UNESCO-sponsored foodbank.
